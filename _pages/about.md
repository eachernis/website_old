My research focuses on using multiple models for macro-economic forecasting and decisionmaking. My recent research shows how to make [monetary policy decisions using multiple models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03321) and how to combine forecasts using [Bayesian Machine Learning methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12671).
