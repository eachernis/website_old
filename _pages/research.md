### Decision synthesis in monetary policy
*(with Gary Koop, Emily Tallman, Mike West)*

The macroeconomy is a sophisticated dynamic system involving significant uncertainties that complicate modelling. In response, decision makers consider multiple models that provide different predictions and policy recommendations which are then synthesized into a policy decision. In this setting, we introduce and develop Bayesian predictive decision synthesis (BPDS) to formalize monetary policy decision processes. BPDS draws on recent developments in model combination and statistical decision theory that yield new opportunities in combining multiple models, emphasizing the integration of decision goals, expectations and outcomes into the model synthesis process. Our case study concerns central bank policy decisions about target interest rates with a focus on implications for multi-step macroeconomic forecasting.

### Predictive Density Combination Using a Tree-Based Synthesis Function
*(with Niko Hauzenberger, Florian Huber, Gary Koop, James Mitchell)*

Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) provides a method for combining multiple predictive distributions based on agent/expert opinion analysis theory and encompasses a range of existing density forecast pooling methods. The key ingredient in BPS is a ``synthesis'' function. This is typically specified parametrically as a dynamic linear regression. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric treatment of the synthesis function using regression trees. We show the advantages of our tree-based approach in two macroeconomic forecasting applications. The first uses density forecasts for GDP growth from the euro area's Survey of Professional Forecasters. The second combines density forecasts of US inflation produced by many regression models involving different predictors. Both applications demonstrate the benefits -- in terms of improved forecast accuracy and interpretability -- of modeling the synthesis function nonparametrically.

### Combining Large Numbers of Density Predictions with Bayesian Predictive Synthesis
*Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics, 2023*

Bayesian Predictive Synthesis is a flexible method of combining density predictions. The flexibility comes from the ability to choose an arbitrary synthesis function to combine predictions. I study choice of synthesis function when combining large numbers of predictions â€“ a common occurrence in macroeconomics. Estimating combination weights with many predictions is difficult, so I consider shrinkage priors and factor modelling techniques to address this problem. These techniques provide an interesting contrast between the sparse weights implied by shrinkage priors and dense weights of factor modelling techniques. I find that the sparse weights of shrinkage priors perform well across exercises.

### A three-frequency dynamic factor model for nowcasting Canadian provincial GDP growth
*(with Calista Cheung, Gabriella Velasco)*  
*International Journal of Forecasting, 2020*

This paper estimates a three-frequency dynamic factor model for nowcasting the Canadian provincial gross domestic product (GDP). The Canadian provincial GDP at market prices is released by Statistics Canada annually with a significant lag (11 months). This necessitates a mixed-frequency approach that can process timely monthly data, the quarterly national accounts, and the annual target variable. The model is estimated on a wide set of provincial, national and international data. In a pseudo real-time exercise, we find that the model outperforms simple benchmarks and is competitive with more sophisticated mixed-frequency approaches (MIDAS models). We also find that variables from the Labour Force Survey are important predictors of real activity. This paper expands previous work that has documented the importance of foreign variables for nowcasting Canadian GDP. This paper finds that including national and foreign predictors is useful for Ontario, while worsening the nowcast performance for smaller provinces.
