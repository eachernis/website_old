### The Business Leaders’ Pulse—An Online Business Survey
*(Chris D'Souza, Kevin MacLean, Tasha Reader, Joshua Slive, Farrukh Suvankulov)*

The Business Leaders’ Pulse is a new online survey conducted each month. It is designed to provide timely and flexible input into the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy decision making while also creating a platform to analyze business conditions and uncertainty. Since May 2021, the Bank has been reaching out to leaders of almost all types of businesses across the country with this short questionnaire inquiring about their sales and employment growth expectations, the risks to their business outlook, and topical questions that address specific information needs of the Bank. This survey is designed to complement the Bank’s quarterly Business Outlook Survey conducted in person. The Business Leaders’ Pulse has already proven valuable in getting timely feedback from firms about the effects of a rapidly changing economic environment, including the impact of COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has also helped Bank staff assess the extent of and reaction to ongoing economic challenges, such as supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortages.

### Disaggregating Household Sensitivity to Monetary Policy by Expenditure Category
*(with Corinne Luu)*

Because the Bank of Canada has started withdrawing monetary stimulus, monitoring the transmission of these changes to monetary policy will be important. Subcomponents of consumption and housing will likely respond differently to a monetary policy tightening, both in terms of the aggregate effect and timing. These differences may be informative for monitoring household responsiveness to, and tracking the transmission of, changes to monetary policy. The authors therefore estimate an empirical model to measure the effects of monetary policy shocks on household expenditures. We find that monetary policy shocks will have a greater, and generally quicker, effect on residential investment than they do on consumption. On average across interest-rate-sensitive subcomponents of real household expenditure, most of the impact is felt on the level after about seven quarters. For residential investment, new construction and ownership transfer costs are affected the most. For consumption, durables and items thought to be highly discretionary (e.g., food and beverages away from home and accommodation services), appear most sensitive to monetary policy shocks.

### Nowcasting Canadian GDP with Density Combinations
*(with Taylor Webley)*

Assessing the state of the economy in real time is critical for policy-making, and understanding the risks to those assessments is equally important. Policy-makers are typically provided with point forecasts that contain insufficient information about risks. In contrast, predictive densities estimate the entire range of possible outcomes. This provides a method for quantifying not only the current state of the economy but also the degree of uncertainty, the tail risks and the overall balance of risks around that state. Accordingly, this paper extends the framework of Chernis and Sekkel (2018) to produce density nowcasts for Canadian real GDP growth. We compare several methods of combining predictive densities from 98 models representing four popular classes of nowcasting models. The performance of these combinations is then assessed in both real-time and pseudo real-time out-of-sample exercises, with the limited sample real-time simulations reinforcing the importance of data revisions for nowcasting. We demonstrate that the combined densities are reliable and accurate tools for assessing the state of the economy and risks to the outlook. We highlight in particular risks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Nowcasting Canadian Economic Activity in an Uncertain Environment
*(with Rodrigo Sekkel)*

This paper studies short-term forecasting of Canadian real GDP and its expenditure components using combinations of nowcasts from different models. Starting with a medium-sized data set, we use a suite of common nowcasting tools for quarterly real GDP and its expenditure components. Using a two-step combination procedure, the nowcasts are first combined within model classes and then merged into a single point forecast using simple performance-based weighting methods. We find that no single model clearly dominates over all forecast horizons, subsamples and target variables. This highlights that when operating in an uncertain environment, where the choice of model is not clear, combining forecasts is a prudent strategy.

### Global Real Activity for Canadian Exports: GRACE
*(with Andr&eacute; Binette, Daniel de Munnik)*

Canadian exports have often disappointed since the Great Recession. The apparent disconnect between exports and the Bank of Canada’s current measure of foreign demand has created an impetus to search for an alternative. Based on a dynamic factor model (DFM) methodology, we use a broad range of international economic indicators (close to 300) to estimate external demand for Canadian exports. The new measure, Global Real Activity for Canadian Exports (GRACE), follows Binette et al. (2014) who suggest that a mix of global final expenditure and production variables could help better identify activity relevant to Canadian exports. They also suggest that non?US variables might be relevant. GRACE uses final expenditure and production variables not only from the United States but also for all of Canada’s major trading partners. We apply this approach to total exports and 14 subaggregates of Canadian exports. Overall, we find that this new measure has good theoretical and empirical properties, especially for higher-level aggregates.
