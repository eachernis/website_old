Ph.D candidate in Economics, University of Strathclyde Principle Economist, Bank of Canada  
Fields: Bayesian Econometrics, Forecasting, Decision Making

My research focuses on using multiple models for macro-economic forecasting and decisionmaking. My recent work shows how to make [monetary policy decisions using multiple models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03321) and how to combine forecasts using [Bayesian Machine Learning methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12671).

I also have extensive experience as a policy economist developing and administering [surveys](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/06/staff-discussion-paper-2022-14/) and [nowcasting systems](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/05/staff-discussion-paper-2022-12/) at the Bank of Canada.
